                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Welcome to <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>, a space dedicated to the art and craft of vintage photography. In a world dominated by digital imagery and instant gratification, we believe in the timeless beauty of analog photography and the stories it tells.</p>
                
                <p>Our blog was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate photographers who share a love for film cameras, darkroom techniques, and the unique aesthetic that only vintage photography can provide. We believe that there's something special about the process of shooting on filmâ€”the anticipation, the careful consideration of each frame, and the tactile nature of the medium.</p>
